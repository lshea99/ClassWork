# ClassWork
A culmination of some of the class work I have worked on here at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Introduction to Database Management and Indroduction to Operating Systems were taken during the Fall and Spring semesters of my Junior year respectively.

Object Oriented and GUI programming, and Data Structures and Algorithms were taken during the Fall and Spring semesters of my Sophomore year respectively.

Classwork and work from my free time will continue to be added as my skills progress.
